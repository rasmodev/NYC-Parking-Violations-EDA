# NYC-Parking-Violations-EDA
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of over 12 million records of parking violations in New York City from July 2020 to June 2021. The analysis explores the distribution of violations by state, top vehicle makes, and peak violation months and days, and provides recommendations for NYC.

# Project Motivation
The goal of this project is to explore the distribution of parking violations in NYC, identify the most common types of violations, and provide insights that can inform policy and enforcement decisions related to parking violations.

# How to use
Open the script in a Python environment, such as Jupyter Notebook.

Download the Clone this repository and open the Jupyter Notebook file nyc_parking_violations_eda.ipynb to run the code.

The notebook contains all the code used in the EDA, as well as detailed explanations of the analysis and insights gained.

# Data
The data for this analysis can be accessed by downloading the nyc-parking-violations-2020.csv dataset.

The dataset contains over 12 million records of parking violations in New York City.

# Insights
The EDA revealed the following insights:

The majority of violations occur in New York state, with Honda vehicles receiving the most violations.
There are significant numbers of missing values in the "Vehicle Make" and "Vehicle Color" columns.
The most common types of plates for vehicles that were issued parking violations were passenger vehicles (PAS) and commercial vehicles (COM).
Sundays registered the highest number of violations, while Tuesdays registered the least number of violations.
November is the peak month for parking violations in the year.

# Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations can be made to the New York City authorities to improve parking violation management:

Increase enforcement efforts in high-violation areas by assessing streets and neighborhoods with the highest rates of violations to understand the root causes and take necessary actions. The city could consider increasing the availability of parking, building more parking garages, implementing a smart parking system, increasing the number of parking enforcement officers, or deploying technology such as license plate recognition systems.
Increase public awareness of parking regulations during peak months.
Encourage alternative modes of transportation, such as public transit and bicycles, to reduce the demand for parking.
